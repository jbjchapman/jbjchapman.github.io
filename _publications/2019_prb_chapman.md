The dynamics of magnetic moments in iron-chromium alloys with different levels of Cr clustering show unusual features resulting from the fact that even in a perfect body-centered-cubic structure, magnetic moments exhibit geometric magnetic frustration resembling that of a spin glass. Due to the long range exchange coupling and configuration randomness, magnetic moments of Cr solutes remain noncollinear at all temperatures. To characterize magnetic properties of Fe-Cr alloys, we explore the temperature dependence of magnetization, susceptibility, Curie temperature, and spin-spin correlations with spatial resolution. The static and dynamic magnetic properties are correlated with the microstructure of Fe-Cr, where magnetization and susceptibility are determined by the size of Cr precipitates at nominal Cr concentrations. The Curie temperature is always maximized when the solute concentration of Cr in the Î± phase is close to 5 to 6 at. %, and the susceptibility of Fe atoms is always enhanced at the boundary between a precipitate and solid solution. Interaction between Cr and Fe stimulates magnetic disorder, lowering the effective Curie temperature. Dynamic simulation of evolution of magnetic correlations shows that the spin-spin relaxation time in Fe-Cr alloys is in the 20 to 40 ps range.
