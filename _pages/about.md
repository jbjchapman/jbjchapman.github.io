I am a post-doctoral scientist working in the Materials Modelling group at the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy researching radiation damage mitigation for reactor materials. I am a developer of the [spin-lattice dynamics code SPILADY](https://ccfe.ukaea.uk/resources/spilady/). I completed my PhD at University College London in 2018, winning the Marshall Stoneham prize for my investigation into domain dynamics and finite size effects of ferroelectric materials. I started my research career studying theoretical physics at the University of York, researching exact correlation in time dependent quantum systems collaborating in the development of the [iDEA code](https://pypi.org/project/idea-code/)
