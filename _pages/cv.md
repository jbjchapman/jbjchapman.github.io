## Education

- 2017 Eng.D, Univeristy College London & National Physical Laboratory
  * Winner of Stoneham-Marshall Prize for Outstanding Research in Condensed Matter Theory
- 2014 MRes, Molecular Modelling and Materials Science, UCL
  * Distinction
- 2013 MPhys, Theoretical Physics, Univeristy of York
  * Starred 1st Class with Distinction (average test score 86 %)

## Work experience

- 2017-Present: Postdoctoral Research Scientist, United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, Culham Centre for Fusion Energy
  Developing scalable models and interdisciplinary design solutions for radiation resistant materials for fusion reactors.
  * Leading the design, integration and testing of new functionality into SPILADY.
  * Successfully written grants to secure over 15 million core-hours on national HPC facilities for high-throughput big-data calculations.
  * Constructed high-dimensional dataset maintained in a relational database (SQLite) to standardise varied longitudinal simulation data.
  * Built python3, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn and pandas based tools to train supervised machine learned interatomic potentials.
  * Developed an artifical neural network suitable for modelling magnetic materials.
  * Performed exploratory data analysis supporting CCFEâ€™s success-ful Athena Swan Bronze Award as a member of the Diversity Panel

- 2013-2017: Doctoral Research, Joint Enterprise with University College London and the National Physical Laboratory
  * Thesis: "Improving the Functional Control of Ferroelectrics using Insights from Atomistic Modelling"
  * Supervised successful MSc project
  * Instigated international collaborations with Queens University Belfast and Carnegie Institute of Science to combine simulation results with experimental data.
  * Developed new models and analysis software to characterise properties of perovskite ferroelectric materials and built tools, algorithms and software hierarchy to achieve research aims. Software used by institutions in UK, Germany and USA.
  * Advanced analytic and mathematical competency to take large and complex data sets and extract meaningful quantitative information.
  * Excellent project management skills handling several innovative concurrent projects, completing deliverables and meeting deadlines, factoring available resources, constraints and slippages
 
- 2009-2013: Undergraduate, University of York
  * Disseration: "Time-Dependent Quantum Dynamics of Interacting Electrons - The Role Correlation"
  * Project designed to improve exchange-correlation energy functionals used in time dependent density functional theory.
  * Optimised pre-existing software (iDEA code) in an unfamiliar language. Achieved a 28-fold improvement in speed and a reduced memory requirement, extending the scope and impact of the project. Enabled the reverse engineering of exact Kohn-Sham potentials for strongly correlated materials.
  * Selected by the Department of Physics and secured funding through the Nuffield Foundation.
  * Formulated new methods to numerically model the exact behaviour of fully interacting electrons subject to time dependent potentials and applied novel correlation measures to illuminate features in quantum dynamics neglected in local and adiabatic approximations.
  * Mentor for the Physics Undergraduate Consultancy Service (2011-2013). Voluntary advisor and tutor the Physics Department walk-in consultancy service.
  * Department of Physics Ambassador (2011-2013) - Our team won the "Vice Chancellor Silver Award for Outstanding Achievement"
  * Elected Physics Society Sports Sectretary (2011-2012)
  * Elected Physics Society Social Sectretary (2010-2011)
