Switchable polarisation of functional ferroelectric ceramics such as lead zirconate titanate PbZr\_(1-x)Ti\_(x)O3 (PZT), a solid solution of PbTiO3 and PbZrO3, makes it a critical component in many technologies, including non-volatile memories, transducers and waveguides. PZT exhibits its greatest piezoelectric properties and electromechanical response at the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) around x=0.5 and this composition has been widely utilised in applications ranging from actuators to inkjet printers. Switching of Ti-rich PZT has been shown to be characterised by creep-depinning due to a nucleation and growth mechanism, reverse switching or successive ferroelastic transitions depending on the driving field orientation [1,2]. However, the dynamic properties of the switching dynamics at low temperatures, vital for applications in aeronautical and space applications, for the MPB regime remain poorly characterised [3].\

In this work, we use large scale molecular dynamics using the shell model forcefield of Gindele et al [4], to model the dynamic switching behaviour of PZT in the vicinity of the MPB composition. We show that, in the absence of domain walls, which precludes creep-depinning, the local B-cation disorder is responsible for temperature dependent, competitive switching mechanisms. We model switching of x=0.5 PZT at 100 K and 300 K, by pre-poling the simulated sample into a [001] tetragonal phased monodomain and then applying a reverse field to facilitate picosecond switching. At 100 K we show that, in the absence of pre-exiting domain walls, diamond-shaped orthorhombic domains, approximately faceted by (101) surfaces, nucleate in the material. These are the 3-dimensional analogues to the bevelled nuclei shown as the growth mechanism on 2-dimensional 180° domain walls [5]. For nuclei exceeding a critical radius, fast growth of the facets forming charged domain walls with the [001] bulk occurs to minimise the electrostatic energy cost (Figure 2a). This growth is followed by conventional domain growth via domain wall motion (Figure 2b). Reverse domains then nucleate in the orthorhombic domain which grow until the sample has switched. A switching process via nucleation of orthorhombic domains provides an explanation for experimental studies on PbZr\_{0.414}Ti\_{0.585}O3 ceramics, where the double peaks in the switching current were proposed to occur due to non-180° domain switching resulting from the residual stresses developed during forward poling [6]. This scenario is supported by the results of small scale MD that suggest bulk-reorientation via an intermediate orthorhombic state in PbTiO3 [7]. Further, we identify that the nucleation and switching are facilitated by Zr-site centred unit cells and by extension, Ti within Zr-rich environment. Since PbZrO3 has an orthorhombic (AFE) groundstate, these clusters allow for the nucleation of locally orthorhombic domains to facilitate growth via lower energy 71° and 109° domain walls without a large elastic energy penalty [1]. We find Ti in Zr-rich environments have suppressed ferroelectric displacements which may incorrectly be perceived as dead-regions. However, we show these Ti-centred unit cells remain ferroelectrically active due to the oxygen-octahedral displacement in the MPB composition. At higher temperatures (300 K), the critical nucleus and barriers for reversal become negligible compared to the thermal fluctuation of dipoles [8] enabling the depinninglike process of fast nucleation of switched nanodomains through a paraelectric state (ie tracing the soft Γ-mode as in PbTiO3).\

This work highlights the subtle complex features of the low temperature atomistic switching mechanisms of PZT at the MPB-composition and proves atomistic level insight that is crucial for the development of functional nanoscale control of switching in ferroelectrics.\
